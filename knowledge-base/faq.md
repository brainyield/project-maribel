# Eaton Academic — Frequently Asked Questions

## Enrollment & Registration

### How do I enroll my child at Eaton Academic?
The enrollment process starts with a free 15-minute consultation call where we learn about your child and your family's needs. After the call, we'll recommend the best program fit and send you the registration forms. You can book a call directly through our Instagram DM or at our Calendly link. The whole process from first call to first day typically takes about 1-2 weeks.

### When can my child start?
Most of our programs accept rolling enrollment, meaning your child can start any time there's availability — you don't have to wait for a new semester. The Microschool has specific enrollment windows (August and January) but may accept mid-year transfers if space is available. [REVIEW NEEDED - confirm rolling enrollment policy]

### Is there a registration fee?
Yes, there is a one-time registration fee that varies by program. For the Microschool, it's $250. For Learning Pods and Eaton Online, it's $75. The registration fee is non-refundable and covers administrative processing and materials setup. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify registration fees]

### Do you require a long-term commitment?
It depends on the program. Learning Pods and Eaton Online are month-to-month with 30 days written notice to withdraw. The Microschool requires a semester commitment. Eaton Hub has no commitment at all — you can drop in whenever you want. Academic Coaching sessions can be purchased individually or in packages.

### Can I switch between programs?
Absolutely! We encourage families to find what works best. If your child is in a Learning Pod and wants to try the Microschool, or vice versa, we'll help you transition. Just give us 30 days notice and we'll coordinate everything.

## Pricing & Payment

### How much do Learning Pods cost?
Learning Pod pricing varies by location and grade level, typically ranging from $150-$195 per month per student. Contact us for current pricing for specific pods. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify price ranges]

### Do you offer sibling discounts?
Yes! For the Microschool, we offer 10% off the second child and 15% off the third child enrolled simultaneously. For Learning Pods, we offer a 10% sibling discount. Ask us about family pricing during your consultation call. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify discount structure]

### What payment methods do you accept?
We accept credit/debit cards, ACH bank transfers, and Zelle. Monthly tuition is charged on the 1st of each month. We also accept payment in full for the semester at a 5% discount. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify payment methods and discount]

### Is there financial aid available?
We want every family to have access to quality education. We offer limited need-based tuition assistance for the Microschool program. Contact us to learn more about availability and the application process. [REVIEW NEEDED - confirm financial aid availability]

### What is your refund policy?
For monthly programs (Pods, Online), if you cancel before the 15th of the month, you won't be charged for the following month. We do not offer partial-month refunds. For the Microschool, refunds follow the semester withdrawal policy outlined in your enrollment agreement. Eaton Hub day passes and punch cards are non-refundable but do not expire. Registration fees are always non-refundable. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify refund policy details]

## Scheduling

### What are Learning Pod schedules?
Each pod meets once a week on its designated day, typically from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM. Different days focus on different grade levels and subjects. For example, Tuesday pods might cover K-2nd grade while Thursday pods serve 6th-8th graders. Contact us for the current schedule at your preferred location.

### Can my child attend multiple pods per week?
Yes! Many families enroll in 2-3 pods per week to get more comprehensive coverage across subjects. We offer multi-pod pricing — ask us about bundle options. [REVIEW NEEDED - confirm multi-pod pricing]

### What time zone are online classes in?
All Eaton Online classes run on Eastern Time (ET). We serve students nationwide, so we try to schedule popular classes at times that work for multiple time zones when possible.

### Do you follow a traditional school calendar?
Our academic year generally follows the Miami-Dade County Public Schools calendar for major holidays and breaks (Thanksgiving, Winter Break, Spring Break, Summer). However, we have some flexibility — for example, we may start our fall term a week later or end a week earlier. The exact calendar is shared during enrollment. [REVIEW NEEDED - confirm calendar alignment]

## Curriculum & Academics

### What curriculum do you use?
We use a blended approach combining established homeschool curricula with teacher-created materials. Our core resources include Singapore Math, IEW for writing, Real Science Odyssey for science, and Story of the World for social studies. Teachers supplement these with novels, hands-on projects, and real-world learning experiences. Our curriculum is rigorous but engaging — we believe learning should be challenging AND fun. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify curriculum choices]

### Are your teachers certified?
All lead teachers at Eaton Academic hold teaching credentials or relevant degrees in education or their subject area. Many of our teachers are former public or private school teachers who chose to work in the homeschool space because they believe in personalized education. All staff undergo background checks and participate in ongoing professional development. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify teacher qualification requirements]

### Do you offer standardized testing?
Yes, we offer annual standardized testing as part of Florida's homeschool evaluation options. We administer the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT-10) and the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS). Testing is typically offered in the spring. Students in the Microschool are automatically included; families in other programs can opt in for an additional fee. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify testing options and timing]

### Do you provide grades and transcripts?
For the Microschool, yes — we maintain official academic records including grades, progress reports, and transcripts. For Learning Pods and Online classes, we provide quarterly progress reports with skill assessments. Official transcripts for high school students are available through our Consulting service for transcript planning.

### Can you accommodate different learning styles or learning differences?
Absolutely. Small group sizes are our biggest advantage here. Our teachers are trained to differentiate instruction and can adapt materials for different learning styles. If your child has an IEP or specific learning needs, let us know during the consultation so we can discuss accommodations. For more intensive support, our Academic Coaching program offers one-on-one attention.

### Is homework assigned?
Learning Pods: Light homework or "continue learning" activities may be suggested but are not mandatory. Online classes: Yes, weekly assignments are expected and contribute to progress assessments. Microschool: Daily homework is assigned in age-appropriate amounts. We believe homework should reinforce learning, not create family stress.

## Locations & Facilities

### Where are you located?
We have locations in Doral and Kendall, with a partner location in Weston. Our main campus is in Doral at the Eaton Academic Center. The Kendall location houses our Microschool and some Learning Pods. Online classes are available from anywhere in the US. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify all locations]

### Is there parking at your locations?
Yes, all our locations have free parking available for drop-off and pick-up. The Doral and Kendall centers have dedicated parking lots. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify parking]

### Can parents stay during pod/class time?
Parents are welcome to stay during the first session to help their child settle in. After that, we ask that parents drop off and pick up, as students tend to engage more fully when learning independently. We have a small parent lounge area if you need to wait. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify parent policy]

## Age Requirements

### What ages do you serve?
Eaton Academic serves students from Kindergarten (age 5) through 12th grade (age 18), depending on the program:
- Learning Pods: Grades K–8
- Eaton Online: Grades 3–12
- Microschool: Grades K–8
- Eaton Hub: Ages 6–14
- Academic Coaching: Grades K–12
- Consulting: All ages/grades

### My child is advanced/behind for their grade — can they be placed differently?
Yes! One of the benefits of our small-group model is flexible placement. We assess each student individually and place them in the group that best matches their academic level, not just their age. A 2nd grader reading at a 4th grade level, for example, might join a higher reading group while staying with age peers for other subjects.

### Do you accept preschool-age children?
Currently, our youngest program starts at Kindergarten (age 5 by September 1st). We do not have a preschool program at this time, but it's something we're exploring for the future. [REVIEW NEEDED - confirm preschool plans]

## Trial Classes & Getting Started

### Can my child try a class before enrolling?
Yes! We offer a free trial day for Learning Pods and the Microschool. Your child can attend a full session to see if it's a good fit. For Eaton Online, we offer a free trial class in any subject. Just book a consultation call and we'll arrange it. [REVIEW NEEDED - confirm trial policy]

### What should my child bring on their first day?
For in-person programs: a backpack with a water bottle, snack, lunch (for full-day programs), a notebook, and pencils. All other materials are provided. For online classes: a computer with webcam, a notebook, and a quiet space to participate. We'll send a detailed "first day" checklist after enrollment.

### What if my child doesn't like it?
We want every family to feel confident in their choice. That's why we offer trial days and a flexible cancellation policy. If after the first month your child isn't thriving, we'll work with you to find a better fit — whether that's a different program, a different schedule, or additional support through coaching.

## Technology (Online Classes)

### What technology does my child need for online classes?
A computer or tablet with a webcam and microphone (a Chromebook works great), stable internet connection (10+ Mbps recommended), Zoom (free version), and a Google account for accessing class materials through Google Classroom. That's it!

### What if my internet connection drops during class?
Don't worry — it happens! Teachers record all live sessions, so if your child misses part of a class due to technical issues, they can watch the recording. Just reach out to the teacher and they'll share the link. If connectivity is a recurring issue, we can help troubleshoot.

### Are online classes recorded?
Yes, all live sessions are recorded and made available to enrolled students for 7 days after the class. This is for review purposes and for students who miss a session. Recordings are not available for purchase separately.

## Homeschool Compliance (Florida)

### Do I need to file anything with the state to homeschool?
Yes, in Florida you need to send a Letter of Intent to your county school district superintendent within 30 days of starting your homeschool program. You also need to maintain a portfolio of your child's work and get an annual evaluation. Our Consulting service can walk you through everything step by step. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify current Florida homeschool law requirements]

### Does attending Eaton Academic count as my child's homeschool program?
Eaton Academic is a homeschool support organization, not a private school. Parents remain the primary educators and are responsible for their homeschool registration with the county. Our programs supplement your homeschool. The Microschool provides a more comprehensive academic experience, but parents still maintain their homeschool status. [REVIEW NEEDED - confirm legal classification]

### Can you help with annual evaluations?
Yes! We can help facilitate annual evaluations through our network of certified evaluators. Microschool families have evaluations built into the program. Families in other programs can arrange evaluations through our Consulting service. [REVIEW NEEDED - confirm evaluation services]

## Safety & Communication

### How do you handle emergencies?
All staff are CPR and First Aid certified. We have emergency protocols posted at all locations and conduct regular safety drills at the Microschool. Parents are contacted immediately for any medical situation. Each student has an emergency contact form on file with authorized pick-up persons listed. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify safety certifications and protocols]

### How do I communicate with teachers?
Microschool parents have access to a parent portal for daily updates, grades, and messaging. Pod and Online parents receive weekly updates via email and can message teachers through the portal. For urgent matters, the front desk is always reachable by phone during operating hours. We respond to all non-urgent messages within 24 hours.

### Do you do background checks on staff?
Yes, all Eaton Academic staff — teachers, coaches, and administrative team — undergo Level 2 background checks (FBI/FDLE fingerprinting) before working with students. [REVIEW NEEDED - verify background check level]
