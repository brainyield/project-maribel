# Eaton Academic — Enrollment Process

## Step 1: Initial Inquiry
The enrollment journey begins when a family reaches out to us. This can happen through:
- Instagram DM (chatting with Maribel)
- Our website contact form
- Phone call to the main office
- Referral from another Eaton family
- Attending an open house or community event

During this first interaction, we learn what the family is looking for and recommend the best program fit.

## Step 2: Free Consultation Call
Every new family is offered a free 15-minute consultation call with a member of our team. During this call we:
- Learn about your child's age, grade, and learning style
- Understand your family's homeschool goals and schedule preferences
- Answer your questions about our programs
- Recommend the best program fit
- Discuss availability and pricing
- Schedule a trial day if interested

You can book this call directly through Instagram DM (Maribel can schedule it for you), or through our Calendly link: https://calendly.com/eatonacademic/15min [REVIEW NEEDED - verify Calendly link]

## Step 3: Trial Day or Trial Class (Optional but Recommended)
We strongly encourage families to try before committing:
- **Learning Pods**: Attend a full pod day for free to see the group dynamic
- **Microschool**: Spend a full school day experiencing the program
- **Eaton Online**: Join a free trial class in any subject
- **Eaton Hub**: Purchase a single day pass ($45) to try the space
- **Academic Coaching**: The initial consultation doubles as an assessment session

Trial days are scheduled at mutually convenient times. Your child participates fully in all activities so you get an authentic experience. [REVIEW NEEDED - confirm trial availability for all programs]

## Step 4: Registration
Once you've decided to enroll, the registration process includes:

1. **Complete the Registration Form**: Fill out our online registration form with student information, medical/allergy details, emergency contacts, and authorized pick-up persons.

2. **Submit Required Documents**:
   - Copy of student's birth certificate or passport
   - Most recent report card or academic records (if transferring)
   - Immunization records or exemption form
   - Florida Letter of Intent to homeschool (or we can help you file one)
   - Any IEP or special accommodation documentation (if applicable)
   [REVIEW NEEDED - verify required documents list]

   - Eaton Hub / Coaching / Consulting: No registration fee
   [REVIEW NEEDED - verify fees]

4. **Sign Enrollment Agreement**: Review and sign the program-specific enrollment agreement covering policies, expectations, and payment terms.

## Step 5: Placement & Orientation
After registration is complete:

- **Academic Placement**: For Microschool and Pods, we may administer a brief placement assessment in reading and math to ensure your child is in the right group. This is not a test to "pass" — it helps us personalize the experience.

- **Welcome Packet**: You'll receive a welcome email with:
  - Your child's schedule and location details
  - Teacher introduction and contact information
  - Supply list (what to bring on the first day)
  - Parent portal login credentials
  - Academic calendar for the current term
  - Parking and drop-off/pick-up procedures

- **Parent Orientation** (Microschool only): A 30-minute orientation session to meet the teachers, tour the facility, and review policies. Scheduled in the week before your child's start date.

## Step 6: First Day
On your child's first day:
- Arrive 10-15 minutes early for check-in
- Meet the teacher and see the classroom
- Parents are welcome to stay for the first 15-20 minutes
- Students receive a welcome kit and are paired with a buddy (Microschool)
- Teachers will send a brief update to parents at the end of the first day

## Step 7: Ongoing Communication & Check-ins
After enrollment:
- **Week 1**: Teacher sends a first-week update via parent portal
- **Month 1**: Brief check-in call with the family to see how things are going
- **Monthly**: Progress reports for Pods and Microschool
- **Quarterly**: Parent-teacher conferences (Microschool) or written progress summaries (Pods/Online)
- **Anytime**: Parents can message teachers through the parent portal or reach the office by phone
