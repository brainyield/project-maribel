# Eaton Academic — Programs

## Learning Pods

### Overview
Learning Pods are Eaton Academic's signature small-group learning experience. Groups of 6-10 students meet in-person with a dedicated teacher for focused academic instruction in core subjects. Pods combine the personalized attention of homeschooling with the social interaction of a traditional classroom. Each pod follows a structured curriculum while allowing teachers to adapt pacing to the group's needs.

### Philosophy
We believe learning happens best in small groups where every student is seen, heard, and challenged at their level. Our pods aren't daycare — they're intentional academic environments where real teaching and real relationships happen.
